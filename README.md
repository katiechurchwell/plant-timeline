# Plant Timeline
## Summary
A resource for the user to determine what plants are currently in season in their area. Eventually (or just aspirationally), the application will be developed into a foraging and hunting resource; providing medicinal, culinary and cultural information on plants.

## About the API Used
This project is currently being built with data from the [National Phenology Network](http://www.usanpn.org/) utilizing an [rOpenSci API interface](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNjupricKOAXn6tY1sI7-EwkcfwdGUZ7lxYv7fcPjO8/edit?usp=sharing) but may switch over to the [iNaturalist API](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference#get-observations-id) in order to have access to more data and photography.

Finding an open source API relevant to the project was difficult. Here is a list of APIs that were researched and may be of interest:
- GBIF.org (BISON)
- rOpenSci: spocc
- USDA Plants Database (https://github.com/USDA/USDA-APIs/issues/7#issuecomment-557136892)
- Open Farm
