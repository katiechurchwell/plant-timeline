# Plant Timeline

## About the Project
This project is currently being built with data from the [National Phenology Network](http://www.usanpn.org/) utilizing an [rOpenSci API interface](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNjupricKOAXn6tY1sI7-EwkcfwdGUZ7lxYv7fcPjO8/edit?usp=sharing).

The vision is to create a resource for the user to determine what plants are currently in season in their area. Eventually (or just aspirationally), the application will be developed into a foraging and hunting resource; providing medicinal, culinary and cultural information on plants.

## Misc Notes.
Finding an open source API to retrieve plant information was difficult. Provided here is a list of APIs that were researched:
- GBIF.org (BISON)
- rOpenSci: spocc
- USDA Plants Database (https://github.com/USDA/USDA-APIs/issues/7#issuecomment-557136892)
- iNaturalist
- Open Farm
